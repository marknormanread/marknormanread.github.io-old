## About me

I am a Lecturer in Biomedical Computation at the University of Sydney, in the School of Computer Science. 

I was awarded my PhD in 2012 by the University of York, UK, for work advancing the investigation of biological systems through simulation and statistics. I had a brief foray into swarm robotics whilst at York. He moved to the University of Sydney's Charles Perkins Centre in 2013 as an independent researcher.
